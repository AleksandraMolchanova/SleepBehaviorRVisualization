# **Sleep Health and Lifestyle**

![](images/sleep.jpg)

*Numerous individuals may not fully comprehend how lifestyle choices and habits can profoundly influence their sleep quality. Various factors play a role in determining sleep quality, including but not limited to body mass index (BMI), occupational demands and stress, smoking habits, level of physical activity, daily step count, the presence of sleep disorders, caffeine consumption, sleep duration, and gender. Other personal and environmental variables, such as age, diet, and exposure to light, can also have an impact.*

*Understanding the correlation between these factors and sleep quality is essential, as poor sleep can have a significant effect on overall health and well-being. In this research, I aim to identify and analyze which factors have a notable effect on sleep quality. By doing so, we can gain insights into potential interventions and recommendations that could improve sleep quality for individuals across various demographics and lifestyles. This could lead to enhanced overall health and productivity and a reduction in health risks associated with sleep disturbances.*

## Sleep Duration per Age and Gender

*The data visualization indicates a trend where older females tend to sleep for more hours as they age, whereas males generally experience a decline in sleep duration after the age of 30. This suggests potential gender differences in sleep patterns across different age groups, which could have implications for health and well-being.*

```{r FinalProject_AleksandraMolchanova, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

gender_colors <- c("Female" = "lightpink", "Male" = "lightblue")


age_breaks <- seq(20, 100, by = 10)
age_labels <- paste(age_breaks[-length(age_breaks)], age_breaks[-1] - 1, sep = "-")

Sleep_lifestyle <- Sleep_lifestyle %>%
  mutate(Age_group = cut(Age, breaks = c(20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100), 
                         labels = age_labels, include.lowest = TRUE))

p <- ggplot(Sleep_lifestyle, aes(x = Age_group, y = Sleep_duration, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = gender_colors) +
  labs(
    title = "Sleep Duration by Age Group and Gender",
    x = "Age Group",
    y = "Sleep Duration (hours)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

print(p)
```

## Sleep Duration by Gender for Occupation

*According to the data visualization, there are notable differences in sleep duration across different occupations and genders. Female engineers stand out for having the highest sleep duration compared to all other groups, encompassing both male and female professionals in various fields. This trend may be attributed to factors such as work-life balance or the specific demands of their engineering roles, which could impact sleep positively.*

*On the other hand, among male professionals, doctors have the highest average sleep duration compared to other occupations. This might seem surprising given the often intense and long hours associated with the medical field, suggesting potential variability within the profession, or differences in work schedules and on-call duties.*

*In contrast, female scientists, as well as both male and female teachers, report the lowest sleep duration. These professions may be associated with high workloads, intense pressure, or responsibilities that extend beyond regular working hours, such as lesson planning for teachers and ongoing research for scientists. This could be contributing to shorter sleep times for individuals in these fields.*

*These findings highlight the influence of occupational demands on sleep duration and point to possible areas for further investigation and potential intervention to improve sleep quality and overall well-being for individuals in these professions.*

```{r FinalProject_AleksandraMolchanova, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

gender_colors <- c("Female" = "lightpink", "Male" = "lightblue")

for (occupation in occupations) {
  
  p <- ggplot(Sleep_lifestyle, aes(x = Occupation, y = Sleep_duration, fill = Gender)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    scale_fill_manual(values = gender_colors) +
    labs(
      title = paste("Box Plot of Sleep Duration by Gender for ocupation"),
      x = "Occupation",
      y = "Sleep Duration"
    ) +
    theme_minimal()

  print(p)
}

```

## Sleep Duration by Gender for occupation

*The data visualization reveals significant differences in sleep duration across BMI categories and gender. Males with a normal BMI sleep longer than individuals in other BMI categories across genders. Specifically, the median sleep duration for males with a normal BMI is approximately 15 minutes longer than for females with a normal BMI, as well as for both males and females in the obese category.*

*Moreover, males with a normal BMI sleep about an hour longer than both overweight males and females. This suggests that maintaining a normal BMI may be associated with better sleep quality and longer sleep duration, particularly for males.*

*These findings highlight the potential impact of BMI on sleep patterns, suggesting that individuals with a normal BMI may experience better sleep outcomes compared to those who are overweight or obese. This could have important implications for health and wellness strategies targeting weight management and sleep improvement.*

```{r FinalProject_AleksandraMolchanova, echo=TRUE}
BMI_Categories <- unique(Sleep_lifestyle$BMI_Category)

for (bmi_category in BMI_Categories) {

  p <- ggplot(Sleep_lifestyle, aes(x = BMI_Category, y = Sleep_duration, fill = Gender)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    scale_fill_manual(values = gender_colors) +
    labs(
      title = paste("Box Plot of Sleep Duration by Gender for bmi_category"),
      x = "BMI_Category",
      y = "Sleep Duration"
    ) +
    theme_minimal()
  
  print(p)
}

```

## Table representing Gender, Occupation, Average of Sleep Duration, and Average of Sleep Quality

*According to the data presented in the table, female doctors and engineers exhibit the highest average sleep duration and quality. This suggests that these professionals may benefit from factors that promote healthy sleep habits, potentially including work-life balance, job satisfaction, or specific aspects of their job environments that support better sleep.*

*In contrast, male sales representatives and female scientists show the lowest average sleep duration and quality. This may be due to various work-related stressors or challenges within their professions, such as demanding hours, high levels of pressure, or job insecurity, which can adversely affect sleep.*

*These findings highlight the potential impact of occupation on sleep patterns and quality, suggesting the need for targeted interventions and support systems to improve sleep for individuals in occupations with lower average sleep duration and quality.*

```{r FinalProject_AleksandraMolchanova, echo=TRUE}
sleep_occupation_table <- Sleep_lifestyle %>%
  group_by(Gender, Occupation) %>%
  summarize(
    Avg_Sleep_Duration = round(mean(Sleep_duration, na.rm = TRUE), 1),  
    Avg_Sleep_Quality = round(mean(sleep_quality, na.rm = TRUE), 1) 
  ) %>%

                         "if (col < rowData.length - 1) {",
                         "td.style.borderRight = '1px solid black';",
                         "}",
                         "}"),
        className = "dt-center" 
      )
    ),
    initComplete = JS("function(settings, json) {",
                      "$(this.api().table().header()).css('background-color', 'lightgray');",
                      "}")
  ),
  rownames = FALSE  
) %>%
  formatStyle(
    columns = NULL,  
    valueColumns = "Gender", 
    backgroundColor = styleEqual(
      c("Female", "Male"),  
      c("lightpink", "lightblue")  
    )
  )

print(datatable)
```

## Sleep quality Vs Sleep Duration based on smoking status and gender

*The visualization indicates that while smoking status does not appear to impact overall sleep quality, it does influence the proportion of deep sleep. On average, smokers experience an 8-10% reduction in the amount of deep sleep compared to non-smokers. This reduction in deep sleep percentage can negatively affect overall sleep quality, as deep sleep is a crucial stage for physical restoration and cognitive function.*

```{r FinalProject_AleksandraMolchanova, echo=TRUE}
data_yes <- subset(Sleep_Efficiency, Smoking_status == "Yes")
data_no <- subset(Sleep_Efficiency, Smoking_status == "No")

plot_yes <- ggplot(data = data_yes, aes(x = Deep_sleep_percentage, y = sleep_quality, color = Gender)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +  
  scale_color_manual(values = gender_colors) +  
  labs(
    title = "Smoking Status: Yes",
    x = "Deep Sleep Percentage (%)",
    y = "Quality of Sleep",
    color = "Gender"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() 

plot_no <- ggplot(data = data_no, aes(x = Deep_sleep_percentage, y = sleep_quality, color = Gender)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +  
  scale_color_manual(values = gender_colors) +  
  labs(
    title = "Smoking Status: No",
    x = "Deep Sleep Percentage (%)",
    y = "Quality of Sleep",
    color = "Gender"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() 

combined_plots <- plot_grid(plot_yes, plot_no, ncol = 2)  

print(combined_plots)


```

*Additionally, the visualization shows that the longer the duration of deep sleep, the higher the reported quality of sleep. This correlation underscores the importance of deep sleep for maintaining good sleep quality and overall health.*

*Furthermore, the visualization suggests that gender does not significantly impact either the percentage of deep sleep or the quality of sleep. This implies that sleep-related interventions and recommendations can be applied consistently across genders.*

```{r FinalProject_AleksandraMolchanova, echo=TRUE}
average_table <- Sleep_Efficiency %>%
  group_by(Gender, Smoking_status) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_deep_sleep_percentage = round(mean(Deep_sleep_percentage, na.rm = TRUE), 1),  
    avg_sleep_quality = round(mean(sleep_quality, na.rm = TRUE), 1)  
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

names(average_table) <- gsub("_", " ", names(average_table))
colnames(average_table)[3] <- "Avg Deep Sleep Percentage"
colnames(average_table)[4] <- "Avg Sleep Quality"
colnames(average_table) <- str_to_title(colnames(average_table))

tab <- kable(
  average_table,
  caption = "<b>Average Values of Deep Sleep Percentage and Quality of Sleep for Each Combination of Gender and Smoking Status</b>",
  align = "c"  
) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"),
    full_width = FALSE,
    position = "center"
  )

tab <- tab %>%
  kableExtra::row_spec(0, background = "lightgray") 

for (i in 1:ncol(average_table)) {
  tab <- tab %>%
    kableExtra::column_spec(i, border_right = TRUE)  
}
for (i in seq_len(nrow(average_table))) {
  gender <- average_table$Gender[i]
  if (gender == "Female") {
    tab <- tab %>% kableExtra::row_spec(i, background = "lightpink")  
  } else if (gender == "Male") {
    tab <- tab %>% kableExtra::row_spec(i, background = "lightblue")  
  }
}
print(tab)
```

## Average Sleep Quality by Alcohol consumption and Gender

*The graph reveals a relationship between alcohol consumption and sleep quality, with distinct differences between genders. Individuals of both genders who do not consume alcohol report an average sleep quality of approximately 7.8, indicating better sleep quality compared to those who do consume alcohol.*

*For females, there is a clear trend showing that increased alcohol consumption is associated with a decline in sleep quality. Notably, sleep quality significantly decreases after consuming alcohol for just one day, suggesting that even moderate alcohol intake can have an immediate and adverse effect on sleep quality for women.*

*Males, on the other hand, exhibit a different trend. After consuming one drink, males report the lowest quality of sleep. However, interestingly, males who consume alcohol for 3-5 days report a higher quality of sleep compared to just one day of consumption. This suggests that the relationship between alcohol consumption and sleep quality may be more complex for males.*

*Based on these observations, gender appears to play a significant role in the impact of alcohol consumption on sleep quality. These findings highlight the need to consider gender-specific factors when examining the effects of alcohol on sleep and when developing recommendations for improving sleep quality.*

```{r FinalProject_AleksandraMolchanova, echo=TRUE}
gender_colors <- c("Female" = "lightpink", "Male" = "lightblue")

avg_sleep_quality <- Sleep_Efficiency %>%
  group_by(Gender, Alcohol_consumption) %>%
  summarize(Avg_Sleep_Quality = mean(sleep_quality, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

p <- ggplot(avg_sleep_quality, aes(x = Alcohol_consumption, y = Avg_Sleep_Quality, color = Gender)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) +  
  scale_color_manual(values = gender_colors) +  
  labs(
    title = "Average Sleep Quality by Alcohol Consumption and Gender",
    x = "Alcohol Consumption (Days)",
    y = "Average Sleep Quality"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() 

print(p)
```

## Average Sleep Duration by Alcohol Consumption and Gender

*The graph indicates a relationship between alcohol consumption patterns and sleep duration that varies by gender. For females, consuming alcohol one day per week is associated with a longer average sleep duration of approximately 7.7 hours. This suggests that moderate alcohol consumption may not have a significant negative impact on sleep duration for women when limited to one day a week.*

*In contrast, males tend to sleep longer—around 7.5 hours on average—when consuming alcohol for three days per week. This pattern indicates that moderate alcohol consumption spread across multiple days may not necessarily lead to reduced sleep duration for men.*

*However, the lowest sleep duration for both genders occurs when alcohol is consumed for five days a week. Females report an average sleep duration of about 7 hours, while males report about 7.1 hours. This trend suggests that frequent alcohol consumption, such as five days per week, can lead to reduced sleep duration for both genders.*

*These findings highlight the complex relationship between alcohol consumption patterns and sleep duration, as well as potential gender differences in how alcohol affects sleep. This information could be useful for guiding recommendations on alcohol consumption and sleep health.*

```{r FinalProject_AleksandraMolchanova, echo=TRUE}
gender_colors <- c("Female" = "lightpink", "Male" = "lightblue")

avg_sleep_duration <- Sleep_Efficiency %>%
  group_by(Gender, Alcohol_consumption) %>%
  summarize(Avg_Sleep_Duration = mean(Sleep_duration, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

p <- ggplot(avg_sleep_duration, aes(x = Alcohol_consumption, y = Avg_Sleep_Duration, color = Gender)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +  
  geom_point(size = 3) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = gender_colors) +  
  labs(
    title = "Average Sleep Duration by Alcohol Consumption and Gender",
    x = "Alcohol Consumption (Days)",
    y = "Average Sleep Duration (hours)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() 

print(p)
```

# Conclusion

Work occupation has a notable impact on the quality of sleep individuals experience. However, when it comes to gender, there is no direct significant influence on sleep quality. Instead, the influence of gender on sleep quality is observed when it interacts with other factors such as body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol consumption, and potentially other lifestyle and health factors. In other words, while gender alone may not affect sleep quality, its effect becomes more pronounced when combined with these other variables. This suggests that the relationship between gender and sleep quality is complex and may depend on a range of interrelated factors.
